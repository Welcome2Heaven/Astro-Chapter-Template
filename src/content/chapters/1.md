It's hot enough outside that the vinyl of the car seat is burning the underside of Emma's thigh, even though they've been sitting in the apartment parking lot for a good ten minutes now in a shady spot. The weather forecast had promised rain and clouds, and instead it's 101 fucking degrees and sunny. Typical.

The heat's not great for the groceries, which are sweltering in the back seat, but Emma's a little too preoccupied with her girlfriend's lips to really give them too much brain activity.

Sasha's hair is all puffed up and frizzy from the humidity, and it keeps getting in both of their faces and mouths. Her fingers are busy sliding up the back of Emma's hoodie, so that leaves Emma with the task of holding Sasha's wavy hair back while they make out. It's a little more public than what they'd normally dare, but nobody's around during work hours on a weekday anyway. Hell, the only reason why they're there is because Sasha's meeting got canceled, and she had nothing else scheduled for the day.

"You're boiling up in this thing, Ems," Sasha murmurs as she peels back Emma's sweater to let some air in against her sweaty back. Sasha says it like she doesn't also exclusively dress like it's autumn year-around.

"Oh fuck, that's nice," Emma groans as the cool air hits her skin. "Guess dysphoria fits aren't known for being lightweight and breathable."

The joke falls too easily from Emma's lips, and Sasha's face does an awkward cross between amused and concerned. "Which is another reason why we should go upstairs."

Emma hums noncommittally and leans forward again for another kiss. Sasha rolls her eyes, faux put-upon, but tilts her head into it too. Her hands go down to curl around Emma's waist like that's their natural place to be. Like touching her like this is so obvious that it's thoughtless.

For a few minutes, Emma completely forgets that they're still in the car at all. Sasha's hands have traveled up Emma's waist to thumb at the underband of her bra, and it's a little embarrassing how just a bit of teasing has her arching against the seat up into Sasha's solid weight.

"Fuck," she breathes, trying to get some friction, but Sasha pushes her back down against the seat easily.

"Language," Sasha scolds, and Emma's eyes snap up to meet hers. She knows that tone of voice. It's the voice Sasha uses when she's pretending to be serious. When she's daring Emma to talk back.

Sasha raises a brow in silent question: do you want to?

"Yes," Emma's voice cracks so she tries again. "Yeah." It's a game they like to play. Sasha roleplays the firm but loving dom, while Emma pretends to be her playful but troublesome brat. It's been a few weeks since their last session, but it's still all too easy to fall into character. Emma crosses her arms defiantly and snarks, "you didn't mind when I cursed like five minutes ago."

Sasha's lip quirks up for a second before she schools it back into place. "You weren't trying to be good for me five minutes ago. But now you are, since that's the only way you're getting to cum tonight." She nudges Emma's chin up with the back of her knuckles. "So, I guess the question is: are you going to be good?"

Being good immediately isn't fun, so Emma makes a show out of considering the question before shrugging nonchalantly. "I don't need you to cum. I could just get myself off, y'know. So this doesn't sound like that great of a deal to me."

Sasha laughs sharply in the way that always makes the hairs on Emma's arms stand up. Like she's just brushed against a live wire. It's sharp and delighted and mocking all at once.

"Fine. Since you want to take care of it yourself so badly, let's see it," Sasha responds easily, leaning back so that she's straddling Emma's legs instead of her lap. "Come on."

"Here?" Emma asks a little incredulously, pretty sure Sasha wouldn't actually want her to put on a show for any passer-by in a place that is technically public. Emma's confident her cheeks are completely flushed by the time Sasha's face finally breaks into a smile and it's obvious that she was just teasing.

"No," Sasha says and pops open the car door, "I was thinking we'd continue this upstairs." Sasha steps onto the pavement and then extends her hand out for Emma to take, "you coming?"

"Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming," Emma grabs Sasha's offered palm and slides out of the car seat.

The scene momentarily falls to the wayside as they kind of just stare at each other for a few moments, holding hands in the parking lot. Sasha's smirk slowly morphs into something softer and genuine, and Emma can't help but return it. She wants to kiss Sasha again, but she also wants to just stand there and enjoy the sudden shift in mood exactly how it is.

She squeezes Sasha's hand a little and feels her heart swell when Sasha squeezes back.

"Alright, let's get the groceries out of the car before we forget," Sasha breaks the silence and Emma gasps.

"Oh shit, I totally forgot about those."
